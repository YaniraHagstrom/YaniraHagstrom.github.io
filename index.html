            <p > Resumes can seem so impersonal sometimes. So I decided I would include a little blurb about myself and what led to my decision to completely alter my professional life and pursue a career in tech. 
            After six long years of what seemed like forever in the Navy, I decided to use my veteran benefits to pursue an undergraduate degree. I hopped majors a couple of times and landed in Civil Engineering. 
            During my Covid career break I took an intro to python course and really enjoyed it. However, I was determined to at least give the civil engineering thing a try. These days I work as a building enclosure consultant for an older, small company that mainly specializes in commercial roofs. The work is a bit repetitive and the admin side is excruciatingly redundant. My brief exposure to coding left me frequently thinking "there has to be a more efficient way that this task can be completed". This thought has passed my mind almost every day since I started my new positon. After many months of this, I decided it was time to do what I believe I will actually enjoy and see myself becoming really good at. So I'm taking the leap.</p>
